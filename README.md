# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program
   
### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).  

To run the simulator on Mac/Linux, first make the binary file executable with the following command:
```shell
sudo chmod u+x {simulator_file_name}
```

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./

## Model Documentation

Here I am going to explain the different approaches used to solve the project, and the final one that worked!

First, I utried to use only frenet coordinates in order to simplify the algorith. Although, this approach didn't work. It started to show jerk, accel an speed alerts because of its discontinuities. So, basically the project really need something that smooth the trajectories. 

Second, I tried to implement the polinomial solver used in previous classes. I used it in 2 different ways. First, I tried one for each coordinate x = f(t), y = f(t) then I tried only one y = f(x). Here, I could make the code work. 

After my fail, I tried a different aproach. I coded an PID controller with a Frenet model similar to my first model. Although, the PID couldn't controll the position. I went out of lanes continuously. 

Finally, I watch your video and reproduce the base code used with the spline library in order to work with the GPU hours left. After a few simple improvements for speed optimization, lane decision making and top speed, It worked great. I tested and it get all the way without incidents. 

After watching the video I probably understood what happened before with my previous approaches. I needed to understad better a few things like speed units, the previous path points and how to generate the trajectory with a few extra points in order to smooth it all. 

-- I have enjoyed so much this project--

##Code Description

After my review, I started to check rear cars. I tested a few times, It worked well without collisions. Also Here is a description of my code: 

//Sections 1: Init Variables (Line 106-121)
Here I set all the variables needed for the algorithm. 
//Section 2: Sensor Fusion : (Line 122-180)
Here I look for all the cars in sensor fusion in order to know two things. If I had a car in front, so I need to decrease speed and I looked for emptiness on side lanes. 
//Section 3: Lane change decision: (Line 180-198) 
Having the lanes states, I took the change lane decision here. So, If I had a car in fron, I looked left first for the lane state, if empty, change lane, if not, I looked right. If there were no empty lanes, just decrease speed and stay in line. 
//Section 4: Spline Trajectory Points: (Line 198-269)
Here I started to create de splines points. First, I put las 2 points of trajectory in order to smooth it out. Also, I create 3 points in future space with the key travel points for the trajectory based on the change lane decision in order to create the spline with them. Finally, We had to transform the point in order to have car coordinate system and create the spline. 
//Section 5: Real Trajectory Points: (Line 269-323)
On section 5, I actually started to create the cars trajectory with the points left of the past cicle. Then, I add the new point based on change lane decision and speed limit with a simple interpolation of points. ( Of couse transforming back the point to global coordinates. )

Thanks for your help. Hope you like it.
